[{"title":"Government funding by taxation VS money creation","path":"/2024/10/12/Government-funding-by-taxation-VS-money-creation/","content":"This is my essay for 2023 John Locke Competition. I got shortlisted and Recommended Prize. The original question is “A government funds its own expenditure by taxing its population. Suppose, instead, it relied solely on money newly created by the central bank? What would be the advantages and&#x2F;or disadvantages?” A government needs a source of income to support its expenditure. There are different approaches to generating revenue, which was the source of political rivalry in the Swedish Parliament in the 1700s. From 1739 to 1772, there was a huge conflict of visions between two political parties known as the Hats and the Caps in the Swedish Riksdag. The Hats advocated financing expenditures with money creation, and the Caps argued that the government funds its expenditure by borrowing and taxation. The two parties’ policies are both imperfect.In 1741, the Hats tried to regain the land lost in the Great Northern War. During this period, the government announced the inconvertibility of bank notes indefinitely because of the substantial money creation. The Hats used a series of policies that included direct subsidies to manufacturers, export subsidies, and the construction of roads and canals to increase economic activity. (Hendrickson,2021) Additionally, the Riksbank offered loans directly to firms and the government. In other words, the hats used financial and monetary policies to stimulate the economy. Besides that, government spending was effectively paid for with new money creation. Unfortunately, the price level went up; the Hats were replaced by the Caps, which carried out a series of policies to contract the money supplies. Interestingly, the Hats’ approach is the same as solely relying on new money created. In this essay, I will address the advantages and disadvantages of this method of funding government expenditure.Beginning with the background of central bank money creation, an independent central bank carries out the monetary policies in modern society. For example, in the United States, the Federal Reserve is the central bank, and one of its main functions is to create money. The central bank creates money by printing money and creating reserves.Firstly, the central bank prints new paper notes and coins (physical money) to increase money creation. According to the Bank of England, banknotes and coins only make up 3% of money creation. (Bank of England, 2023) It is not the main source of money now. It has been replaced by creating digital reserves with the development of technology. But this does not reduce the power of the central bank; in contrast, it boosts the power of the central bank to stabilise the economy.Secondly, when it comes to creating reserves, the central bank can do either one of two things: open market operation or quantitative easing. The two methods which create the main source of money today - digital money. Open market operation means the central bank purchases short-term securities from commercial banks, individuals, and institutions in the open market. In this way, the demand for securities is stimulated, increasing the price and decreasing the yield. So, the commercial bank has more reserves to support them to lend to businesses, and the interest rate falls. On the other hand, quantitative easing (QE) entails the central bank purchasing longer-term bonds and mortgages to push their prices up and bring down long-term interest rates. It was first introduced in 2001 by the Bank of Japan and populated in the Global Financial Crisis. (Bank of England, 2023) It helps the commercial bank have more liquidity and will not face the interest trap. Mostly, the money the central bank creates is used to support monetary policies. So, they can achieve various macroeconomic objectives, such as attaining full employment, achieving a balance of payments, and pursuing stable and sustainable economic growth. But money creation is only one of the sources of government funding. (McLeay and Radia, 2014)Before analysing the advantages of relying solely on central bank money creation, one must examine the Modern Monetary Policy(MMT). MMT is based on Chartalism, which argues that the value of a currency is derived from its status as legal tender. (Wray, 2014) Furthermore, the money the government borrows from the central bank is fiat money, the unit of account. The government and its central bank must only type the credits and debits. It means the borrowed money is not the real deficit, while the loan, based on the money token like banknotes or coins, is the real deficit. So there is no risk for the government to go bankrupt; it is impossible. The government can use the money created by the central bank to increase spending. This can provide better flexibility for the government to respond. They can increase the money supply in recession or decrease expansion to decrease the amplitude(vertical distance between peak and trough) - stabilise the economy.As we mentioned before, money creation relies on reserve creation now. With more reserves, commercial banks can lend out more money. Also, the banks are willing to lead out more to maximise their profits. So in the loan market, the supply increases while the demand is fixed, and the price(interest rate) decreases. Households can bear the burden of a mortgage to purchase a house or a car at lower interest rates. So they bear less risk and keep their living standards to the maximum extent. Companies can borrow at lower interest rates. So they have better liquidity to flow capital. For the economy, private investment and consumption will be encouraged, which can help the economy get rid of the recession more efficiently.When we remove taxation, the economy will change significantly. It is bold to imagine an economy with a surcharge removed since dramatic changes will follow. Without direct taxes such as income tax, people can earn more disposable income, which improves their purchasing power. This expands aggregate demand. On the other hand, without indirect taxes such as VAT, the production cost reduces, boosting supply. The total output can increase at a higher rate through the interaction of expanded demand and increased supply. Besides that, higher disposable income leads to better quality of living. Therefore, workers have more incentive to work harder and have more sense of gain. For the economy, better work productivity makes the resource used more efficiently, which means actual economic growth. Also, a better living quality will free up more time for thinking and researching, which could improve the global landscape for technology and unleash waves of technological breakthroughs. The upper limit of output will increase, and the economy will gain potential growth.Inflation will become a key concern in this hypothetical scenario that the question invites us to consider. Fisher’s “exchange equation of money” provides a tool for us to study the quantity theory of money(Persons, 1911):PY&#x3D;MV(M &#x3D; money supply, V &#x3D; velocity of money, P &#x3D; price level, Y &#x3D; real GDP).When we assume that V and Y are both constant, P and M are positively correlated: when the money supply increases, the price level goes up. So the inflation rate increases with money creation. Someone will say the central bank sets the target inflation rate at 2%(Bank of England, 2023), so it is better to fix the inflation rate at 2%. While the new money creation will lead to a higher inflation rate, the government should refrain from using it to support its expenditure. However, this is not a problem according to the Keynesian school’s Long Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS curve), as when the price level increases, there will always be a new equilibrium that shows higher real GDP until full employment. There are many types of unemployment, and attaining full employment is almost impossible. And the negative economic consequences–workers who earn low and fixed incomes will lose their purchasing power with higher living costs–can be solved by the stronger power of unions. Overall, inflation is not a problem in money creation. Instead, it makes higher real GDP in most situations. Although the strategy helps the economy, the government spending relying solely on central bank creation does bring practical problems. The first problem is about the government’s credibility. The South Asian country Sri Lanka has abolished several taxes such as Pay As You Earn Tax (PAYE), Nation Building Tax (NBT), Withholding Tax on Interests, Debit Tax, Capital Gains Tax, and Debt Services Tax in 2019. (Sardar, 2022) It has made the deficit doubled between 2019 and 2020. So the government keeps increasing its money creation to cover the expenditures. But this operation was opposed by the International Monetary Fund(IMF) and rating agencies downgrading the sovereign credit rating. (George,2022) It hurts the economy more. People are worried about the pay-back ability of the Sri Lanka government, so they lend less money which hurts the liquidity of the government. Because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the rising oil price gave the last hurt to this country–the country went bankrupt. This may decrease the risk-bearing ability and the credibility of the government.The second problem is about equity. One of the important functions of taxation is redistribution. The progressive income tax asks the rich to pay a higher tax rate and the poor to pay a lower one. In England, the people who earn taxable income over £125,140 annually should bear 45% tax rates, while those who earn taxable income under £12,570 annually do not need to pay taxes. (GOV.UK, 2023) So the gap between the disposable income of the poor and the rich is narrowed. If the government stops taxing its citizens, there will be no progressive income tax to promote equity. Although the inflation caused by new money creation will hurt the rich more than the poor because of more wealth, it cannot be efficient–in common, the rich will separate their income, like gold, stocks, and assets. It helps the rich keep their wealth and almost ignores inflation. At the same time, people with low incomes do not have so many ways to do this. So the new money creation without tax will widen the existing large inequality of wealth.Let us go back to the real world. In 2023 under the impacts of the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the economies worldwide have deteriorated. But the real GDP in Japan grew 2.7% in the first quarter of the year, faster than the earlier prediction of 1.6%. In other words, Japan has succeeded in recovering its economy. (Government of Japan,2023) The growth is relevant to QE-new money creation. Although Japan did not cut all the taxes and the expenditure did not rely on new money creation, the example showed the power of relying solely on money creation to push economic growth.Suppose the government tries to become a more extreme version of “Japan” by funding its expenditures solely relying on new money creation. In that case, the economy will be more stable and have stronger pressure to push economic growth. At the same time, the government’s credibility and equity will be hurt. But compared with the advantages we mentioned, the disadvantages do not have so much power to impede economic development. The government can repay the bonds on time to build a good credit record. So the rating agencies will trust the government. Also, the government can use its budget to create completed social welfare and transfer payments. An effective and efficient government can solve these disadvantages. So the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Therefore, funding the government solely on the newly created money might be a good attempt when we want to stimulate the economy. Still, considering the disadvantages, it is best to be tried in good-credit countries and efficient government.

Originally associated with the ideas of the US People’s Party, founded in 1892, populism has since evolved to encompass mass manipulation. While scholars may debate its precise definition—whether as a phenomenon, ideology, or something else—one defining feature remains: it divides society into “pure” people and “corrupt” elites, applicable to both right- and left-wing populism. Historically, the Jacobins of the French Revolution, led by Robespierre, were among the first populists. After the overthrow of the Ancien Régime, the Assembly seized power, and groups like the Jacobins emerged. For various reasons, the Assembly failed to meet the public’s expectations regarding civil rights and inflation. In this context, the Jacobins tapped into citizens’ discontent with the Constitutional Monarchy, exploiting public trust to rally the sans-culottes for violent uprisings. This ultimately led to the overthrow of the monarchy but also spiralled into the Reign of Terror, during which tens of thousands lost their lives. Even in modern society, populist politicians are known for skilfully connecting the grievances of average citizens to the dominance of elites in commercial, political, and media spheres. Take Donald Trump, the former president of the United States, as an example. His personal charm attracts support, particularly from citizens in rural areas, which has enabled him to compete for the presidency multiple times. However, he utilizes this support not only to strengthen his personal cult but also to exacerbate social divisions. According to a Washington Post article from October 4, 2016 , Trump claimed to know better than anyone else about 19 issues, despite being merely mortal and not omniscient. Consequently, after losing the 2020 election, many of his most loyal supporters denied the election’s legitimacy, believing unfounded conspiracy theories that alleged Joe Biden and the Democrats had cheated. This anger over what they perceived as an “unfair” election result culminated in the attack on the Capitol, a symbol of American authority, as they demanded a re-election. By examining both the French Revolution and the 2020 Capitol Attack, I have come to recognize the power of populism and the importance of harnessing it for societal benefit, which motivates me to conduct further research on the topic. 为开始这个讨论，我们首先来探讨民粹主义的概念。最初，这一术语与1892年成立的美国人民党相关，后来发展为涵盖大众操控。虽然学者们可能会争论它的确切定义——是否作为一种现象、意识形态或其他——但有一个明确的特征依然存在：它将社会分为“纯洁”的人民和“腐败”的精英，这一特征适用于右派和左派民粹主义。 历史上，法国革命时期由罗伯斯庇尔领导的雅各宾派是最早的民粹主义者之一。在推翻旧制度后，国民大会掌握了权力，像雅各宾派这样的团体随之出现。由于种种原因，国民大会未能满足公众在公民权利和通货膨胀方面的期望。在这种背景下，雅各宾派利用了公众对宪政 monarchy的不满，利用民众信任号召无裤者进行暴力起义。这最终导致了对君主制的推翻，但也引发了恐怖统治，在此期间数万人失去了生命。 即使在现代社会，民粹主义政治家也以巧妙地将普通市民的不满与精英在商业、政治和媒体领域的主导地位联系起来而闻名。以唐纳德·特朗普为例，作为美国前总统，他凭借个人魅力吸引了许多来自农村地区的选民支持，使他能够多次竞争总统职位。然而，他利用这种支持不仅巩固了自己的个人崇拜，还加剧了社会的分裂。根据2016年10月4日《华盛顿邮报》的一篇文章，特朗普声称他对19个问题比任何人都了解，尽管他不过是一个普通人，并非无所不知。因此，在2020年选举失利后，他最忠实的支持者中许多人否认选举的合法性，认为无根据的阴谋论声称乔·拜登及其民主党人进行了舞弊。这种对他们所认为的“不公正”选举结果的愤怒最终导致对国会大厦的攻击，国会大厦作为美国权威的象征，支持者们要求重新选举。 通过观察法国革命和2020年国会大厦袭击这两个例子，我认识到民粹主义的力量以及将其用于社会利益的重要性，这促使我进一步研究这一主题。 The formation of populismAs I mentioned earlier, the populist narrative divides society into “pure” people and “corrupt” elites. This prevalent theory is based on three main prerequisites: The disadvantaged position of the masses The exacerbation of societal divisions The naivete of the masses Due to the naivete of citizens, politicians can manipulate them, gaining their trust by promoting conspiracy theories and personal cults. Consequently, these politicians can secure support and votes from the public. I will analyze these three points further. To be convenient, I will only take America as an example. When I have more time, I will give an example in Latin America or China(example of Left populism) 正如我之前提到的，民粹主义的叙事将社会划分为“纯洁”的民众和“腐败”的精英。这一理论的流行基于三个主要前提： 民众的弱势地位 社会分裂加剧 民众的天真 由于民众的天真，政客们可以操纵民众，通过宣传阴谋论和个人崇拜来获得民众的信任。因此，这些政客可以获得民众的支持和选票。我将进一步分析这三点。 为了方便，我只用美国举例。等我有更多时间之后，我将会给一个拉丁美洲或者中国的例子（左翼民粹主义）。 The disadvantaged position of the masses As the above graph show, most of Trump’s votes came from the rural area and small-town midsections The exacerbation of societal divisionsThe naivete of the masses","categories":["sociology 社会学"]},{"title":"Hello World","path":"/2024/08/23/hello-world/","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
